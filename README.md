User is presented with a Password Generator complete with button that when clicked, presents  a series of prompts in order to generate the required password.
User to establish length of password between 8 - 128 characters and then;
User to confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
When user answers each prompt each selected should be validated with at least one character type (or more / or all) selected;
When all is valid then a password is generated


## INSTALLATION

With existing code and accompanying brief provided, reviews were made within VS Code and pushed to Github where a holding website was launched for approval.

## Usage
Files consist of:
index.html
script.jss

## CREATION OF index.html
This is a personal note for marking purposes.  I have REALLY struggled with this assignment as I have never touched code before.  I enlisted the help of a tutor who walked me through the process and the index.html is the result of this work.  Although some of the methods are different and I though the code is long, we followed this line of thought in order to set it out in full for my benefit.
